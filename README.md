# About [The Offcuts](https://theoffcuts.org)

Think about the shop: the wood shop, the metal shop, the sewing shop, the print shop. Now think about that box of offcuts: the beautiful, strange, oddly-shaped extra parts that were left over when the other thing was produced. Theyâ€™re free; you can make anything you want with them, [if you have an idea](https://theoffcuts.org).
