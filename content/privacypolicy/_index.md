# Privacy

The policy is that you have privacy. This site has no cookies. I don't have access to the visitor logs. Your personal information is not collected. The responsible party under the TKG is Halle Winkler, however, I have no information of yours that I could keep or remove, so there is nothing for a responsible party to undertake. Weird.
