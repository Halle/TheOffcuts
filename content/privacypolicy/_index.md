# Privacy

The policy is that you have privacy. This site has no cookies or accounts so there is no way to persist any information about you here. I don't have access to the visitor logs. Your personally identifiable information is not collected by this blog or by me. The webhost is Github Pages, which means it is possible that you have a different privacy relationship with Github, so you can also check out [their privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

Consequent to the fact that this is a personal blog with no way of storing information about you, there is no DPO because there would be nothing for them to do.

The responsible party under the TKG is Halle Winkler, and you can contact me [here](https://www.politepix.com/the-offcuts-contact/).
